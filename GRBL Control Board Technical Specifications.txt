# GRBL Control Board Technical Specifications for FoxAlien Masuter 3S CNC Machine

## GRBL version and board specifications

The FoxAlien Masuter 3S uses a **GRBL v1.1f-based controller** implemented on standard Arduino architecture. The control board features an ATmega328P microcontroller running at 16 MHz, communicating through a CH340 USB-to-serial converter chip.  The board is housed in a custom dust-proof controller box with integrated emergency stop and homing buttons. 

**Key hardware specifications:**

- Microcontroller: ATmega328P (16 MHz, 32KB Flash, 2KB SRAM)
- USB Interface: CH340 USB-to-serial converter 
- Motor Control: 4x stepper drivers for NEMA23-76 closed-loop motors 
- Spindle Control: PWM output for 400W spindle (up to 30,000 RPM) 
- Input/Output: Limit switch inputs, probe input, emergency stop

## USB serial communication protocol details

The GRBL controller communicates using a straightforward serial protocol with these parameters: 

**Serial Configuration: 115200-8-N-1**

- Baud rate: 115200 bps (fixed, requires firmware recompilation to change) 
- Data bits: 8
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1
- Flow control: None (software-based through character counting)

**Buffer Management:**

- Serial RX buffer: 128 characters maximum  
- Planner buffer: 16 motion blocks  
- Line length limit: 127 characters  

The controller supports two streaming protocols. The **send-response protocol** sends one command and waits for “ok” or “error:” before sending the next. The **character-counting protocol** tracks buffer usage to maximize throughput by keeping the 128-character buffer optimally filled. 

## Command acknowledgment and response patterns

GRBL provides deterministic response patterns for reliable communication: 

**Standard Responses:**

- `ok` - Command successfully parsed and executed 
- `error:XX` - Error occurred with specific error code (1-38) 

**Push Messages:**

- `ALARM:X` - Emergency alarm state (codes 1-10) 
- `[MSG:text]` - Feedback messages 
- `<status>` - Real-time status reports 

**Status Report Format:**

```
<State|Position|Additional_Data>
```

Example: `<Run|WPos:10.500,5.250,0.000|FS:500.0,8000|Ov:100,100,100>` 

States include: Idle, Run, Hold, Jog, Alarm, Door, Check, Home, Sleep.  Position data shows either machine coordinates (MPos) or work coordinates (WPos), along with feed/spindle speeds and override percentages. 

## Complete G-code command support

The Masuter 3S supports the standard GRBL v1.1 command set: 

**Motion Commands:**

- G0: Rapid positioning (up to 10,000 mm/min) 
- G1: Linear interpolation with feedrate 
- G2/G3: Circular interpolation (clockwise/counterclockwise) 
- G38.2-G38.5: Probe commands 

**Coordinate Systems:**

- G17/G18/G19: Plane selection 
- G20/G21: Inch/millimeter modes 
- G53: Machine coordinate movement 
- G54-G59: Work coordinate systems 
- G90/G91: Absolute/incremental positioning 
- G92: Temporary coordinate offset 

**Other G-codes:**

- G4: Dwell 
- G10: Set coordinate system data 
- G28/G30: Go to predefined positions 
- G43.1: Dynamic tool length offset 

**M-codes:**

- M0/M1: Program pause 
- M2/M30: Program end 
- M3/M4/M5: Spindle control (CW/CCW/Stop) 
- M7/M8/M9: Coolant control 
- M56: Parking override control

**Real-time Commands (immediate execution):**

- `?`: Status query  
- `~`: Cycle start/resume  
- `!`: Feed hold  
- `Ctrl-X` (0x18): Soft reset  
- `0x84-0xA1`: Various overrides and toggles 

## Configuration commands ($-commands)

**View Commands:**

- `$$`: View all settings 
- `$#`: View coordinate parameters 
- `$G`: View parser state 
- `$I`: View build info 
- `$N`: View startup blocks 

**Control Commands:**

- `$H`: Run homing cycle 
- `$X`: Kill alarm lock 
- `$C`: Check mode toggle 
- `$J=`: Jog command 

**Settings ($0-$132):** Each axis has configurable steps/mm, max rate, acceleration, and travel limits. Key settings include step pulse timing, direction inversion, homing parameters, and spindle configuration. 

## FoxAlien-specific implementations

While the Masuter 3S uses standard GRBL v1.1 firmware without proprietary modifications, it includes several machine-specific configurations: 

**Default Configuration Values:**

- $100/$101: 80.0 steps/mm (X/Y axes)
- $102: 400.0 steps/mm (Z axis)
- $110/$111: 8000.0 mm/min max rate (X/Y)
- $112: 1000.0 mm/min max rate (Z)
- $130/$131: 400.0 mm max travel (X/Y standard, 800mm for extension kit) 
- $132: 95.0 mm max travel (Z) 
- $30: 30000 RPM max spindle speed

**Unique Features:**

- Closed-loop stepper motor support (prevents step loss) 
- Homing to front-left corner at machine coordinates (-377, -377) 
- Extension kit support requiring `$130=800` setting 
- Physical homing button on controller box 
- 400W spindle with manual speed control knob 

## Initialization and homing procedures

**Startup Sequence:**

1. Install CH340 USB driver (required) 
1. Power on controller box
1. Connect via USB at 115200 baud 
1. Send any character to wake GRBL  
1. Receive: `Grbl 1.1f ['$' for help]` 
1. Query status with `?`
1. Execute homing with `$H` or physical button  

**Homing Behavior:**

- Moves to front-left corner in negative X/Y direction
- Engages limit switches on all axes
- Sets machine position to (-377, -377, 0) 
- Pulls off switches by configured distance
- Ready for work coordinate setting

**Work Coordinate Setup:**

1. Move to desired work origin
1. Set using G10 or G92 commands 
1. Use G54 (default) coordinate system 
1. Z-probe supported for tool height setting

## Error handling and diagnostics

The controller provides comprehensive error reporting with 38 distinct error codes for G-code issues and 10 alarm codes for machine states.   Common errors include invalid commands (error:20), undefined feedrate (error:22), and travel exceeded (error:15). Alarm states cover hard limit triggers, homing failures, and probe errors. 

## Implementation recommendations for simulation

For accurate grbl_driver_agent simulation:

1. **Serial Communication**: Implement 115200-8N1 serial protocol with 128-character RX buffer tracking 
1. **Command Processing**: Parse incoming commands, validate syntax, and generate appropriate ok/error responses
1. **State Machine**: Track machine state (Idle, Run, Hold, etc.) and transition based on commands and conditions
1. **Coordinate Systems**: Maintain machine and work coordinate transformations for G54-G59 
1. **Motion Planning**: Simulate acceleration/deceleration profiles respecting configured limits
1. **Real-time Status**: Generate status reports on `?` queries with current position and state
1. **Error Simulation**: Implement boundary checking and return appropriate error codes
1. **Buffer Management**: Simulate character-counting protocol for realistic streaming behavior

The FoxAlien Masuter 3S represents a standard GRBL v1.1 implementation with machine-specific configurations rather than firmware modifications, making it compatible with all standard GRBL communication protocols and software  while optimizing for its closed-loop motor system and 400W spindle capabilities.
