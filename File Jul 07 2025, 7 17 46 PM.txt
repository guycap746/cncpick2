🧠 cncpick2 – Modular Pick-and-Place System with Simulation & AI Agents

cncpick2 is a modular, agent-driven CNC pick-and-place pipeline with live simulation, vision inference, scoring, and motion execution—supporting real-time GRBL CNC hardware or simulated conveyor-based object flows.

🚀 Key Features
	•	⚙️ Agent-based architecture using ZeroMQ
	•	📦 Simulated conveyor system with object spawner
	•	🧠 YOLO-based vision detection and depth capture
	•	🪄 Object scoring and assignment to CNC arms
	•	🦾 CNC motion control via G-code (GRBL or mock)
	•	🧪 Sanity tests, playback tools, and calibration visualizers
	•	📊 Web-based dashboard and remote monitoring
