🚀 Deployment Automation Tools – cncpick2

This document outlines a strategy and tooling approach for deploying the cncpick2 system in both simulation and physical environments using repeatable automation.

⸻

🎯 Purpose
	•	Eliminate manual deployment steps
	•	Consistently provision all required agents and dependencies
	•	Support dev, sim, and production profiles

⸻

🧰 Tooling Stack

Tool	Role
Makefile	Common commands (make run-sim)
Docker	Containerized agent environments
docker-compose	Multi-agent orchestration (optional)
bash	Lightweight entrypoint wrappers
requirements.txt / pyproject.toml	Python deps mgmt


⸻

🧱 Project Structure Example

/scripts/
  ├── launch_sim.sh
  ├── launch_hardware.sh
  └── teardown.sh
/Dockerfile
/docker-compose.yml
/Makefile


⸻

⚙️ Makefile Examples

run-sim:
	python bootstrap.py --profile sim

run-hardware:
	python bootstrap.py --profile hardware

docker-build:
	docker build -t cncpick2 .


⸻

🌐 Optional Cloud Targets
	•	GitHub Codespaces (sim only)
	•	Railway or Heroku (dashboard + logs)
	•	AWS EC2 AMI prebuild for motion/vision combo
