🌍 Remote Monitoring & Telemetry – cncpick2

This document outlines the system hooks and tooling for observing the cncpick2 system from a remote location, focusing on diagnostics, telemetry, and alerting.

⸻

🎯 Purpose
	•	Enable headless deployments to be observable
	•	Provide developers and operators with remote insights
	•	Allow system-wide KPIs to be tracked in real time

⸻

🛰️ Monitored Data Types

Type	Source Agent	Example Metric
System Heartbeats	all agents	last_seen, uptime
Motion Events	motion_agent	pickup_time, z_speed
Detection Events	vision_agent	object_count, frame_rate
Missed Objects	post_pick_monitor	count_per_lane
Faults & Alerts	safety_agent	halt_reason, fault_rate


⸻

🔌 Export Targets

Method	Use Case
JSONL stream	Raw audit/event capture
SQLite file	Debug sessions
MQTT (future)	Live dashboard or IoT bridge
REST push	Send to monitoring server or Grafana


⸻

📶 Uplink Models
	•	telemetry_agent (optional module):
	•	Subscribes to all agent PUB sockets
	•	Applies filter and rate-limit rules
	•	Pushes structured payloads remotely

⸻

📊 Suggested KPIs
	•	Detection → Pickup success rate
	•	CNC idle time by lane
	•	Mean pickup delay
	•	Fault rate by agent type
	•	Sanity test pass/fail trend

⸻

🧪 Test Setup
	•	Use telemetry_sim.sh to mock a long run
	•	Visualize trends with Jupyter or Grafana
	•	Inject faults to verify reporting

📌 Summary

Remote telemetry completes the feedback loop for cncpick2 deployments, providing insight during continuous use, regression tests, and performance tuning—even when off-site or embedded in remote enclosures.
