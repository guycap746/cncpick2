🔁 Simulator Playback System – cncpick2

This document outlines the design for a playback tool that re-runs previous logged simulation sessions for debugging, visualization, and comparison purposes.

⸻

🎯 Purpose
	•	Replay historical sessions frame-by-frame
	•	Compare different detection or scoring strategies
	•	Debug misbehaving agents or missed pickups

⸻

📥 Input Requirements

Source File	Contents
logs/session_*.jsonl	Full event timeline
frames/*.png	Optional RGB overlays (if exported)
calibration/*.json	Camera-to-CNC transform matrix


⸻

🖼️ Playback Features

Feature	Description
Time scrubbing	Play/pause or jump to timestamp
Agent annotation view	See who made each decision
Overlay visualization	Detection boxes, lanes, pickup zones
Comparison mode	Side-by-side vs alternate config run


⸻

🧰 Implementation Tools
	•	streamlit or PyQt for UI
	•	JSONL parser with frame lookup hooks
	•	Use same vision overlay tools for continuity

⸻

📦 Output Options
	•	Save annotated video clips
	•	Export discrepancy reports (e.g., assigned vs missed)
	•	Frame export for notebook review

⸻

📌 Summary

The simulator playback system enables powerful retrospective analysis of system behavior, essential for debugging, training data refinement, and tuning YOLO/assignment logic over time.
