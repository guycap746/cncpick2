🧠 Future Agent Profile: learning_feedback_agent – cncpick2

This document outlines a future enhancement agent intended to analyze performance trends and guide system improvements.

⸻

🧠 Agent Overview
	•	Aggregates data from other agents
	•	Tracks pickup success, false negatives, match confidence
	•	Feeds back into system for continuous improvement
	•	Optional in early stages, but powerful for long-term tuning

⸻

📂 Responsibilities
	1.	Ingest events from vision_agent, motion_agent, post_pick_monitor_agent
	2.	Track:
	•	Successful pickups per lane
	•	Detection-to-pickup accuracy
	•	Object sizes and success rates
	3.	Suggest score weight changes or vision model thresholds

⸻

📥 Subscribed Events
	•	object_detected
	•	object_picked
	•	object_missed
	•	object_never_assigned

⸻

📤 Optional Published Events

scoring_tweak_suggestion

{
  "event": "scoring_tweak_suggestion",
  "payload": {
    "recommendation": "Increase area weight for lane 2"
  }
}

detection_model_feedback

{
  "event": "detection_model_feedback",

📌 Summary
	•	Gathers cross-agent performance data
	•	Can suggest vision or scoring refinements
	•	Optional, but enables intelligent system evolution
	•	Ideal for production tuning or ML-integrated variants
