📊 Future Agent Profile: metrics_agent – cncpick2

This document defines a future metrics aggregation agent that will provide real-time and long-term performance statistics for the cncpick2 system.

⸻

🧠 Agent Overview
	•	Gathers structured performance metrics across the system
	•	Computes KPIs: throughput, pickup accuracy, object wait time, assignment latency
	•	Exposes metrics in a format compatible with dashboards or Prometheus

⸻

📂 Responsibilities
	1.	Aggregate events from all system agents
	2.	Maintain real-time counters and moving averages
	3.	Periodically publish metrics to disk or HTTP endpoint

⸻

📥 Subscribed Events
	•	object_spawned
	•	object_detected
	•	object_assigned
	•	object_picked
	•	object_dropped
	•	object_missed

📤 Published Stats

Example Metric Frame (JSON or Prometheus text format)

{
  "timestamp": "...",
  "throughput_per_minute": 24,
  "pickup_success_rate": 0.96,
  "avg_time_to_pickup": 3.42,
  "missed_pickups": 1
}


⸻

📈 KPIs Tracked
	•	Total objects seen vs. picked
	•	Avg time from spawn → detect → assign → pickup
	•	Lane-based breakdowns
	•	Rolling error rate per agent

⸻

⚙️ Configuration Fields

metrics_agent:
  publish_interval_sec: 10
  output_format: "json"

⸻

📌 Summary
	•	Produces performance insights in real time
	•	Optional but valuable for optimization
	•	Bridges system behavior with observability dashboards
