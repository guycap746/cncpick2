# Assistant Recommendations - NOT Part of Current Design

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: These are suggestions from the AI assistant and are NOT part of the current cncpick2 design documentation. They should be considered separately for future enhancements.**

## Critical Design Issues Found

### 1. Object ID Tracking in Production

**Issue**: No simulator in real deployment to generate IDs
**Resolution Adopted**: Vision agent generates IDs in production during YOLO classification

### 2. Timeout Mechanisms

**Recommendation**: Add basic timeouts to each agent for MVP:

- Motion waiting for trigger: 5 seconds
- Trigger watching for object: 10 seconds
- Assignment to completion: 30 seconds
- On timeout: publish event, return to ready state

### 3. Belt Speed Synchronization

**Resolution Adopted**: Vision agent estimates speed in production by tracking objects

### 4. Message Routing Optimization

**Recommendation**: Use ZeroMQ topic filtering:

```python
# Motion agent subscribes to its specific topic
sub_socket.subscribe(f"motion_agent_0:".encode())

# Scoring agent publishes with topic prefix
pub_socket.send_string(f"motion_agent_0: {json.dumps(message)}")
```

### 5. State Tracking Service

**Recommendation**: Add object state tracking:

- Detected → Assigned → Picking → Picked → Dropped
- Shared state accessible by all agents
- Prevents double-assignment

## Immediate Recommendations (Pre-Implementation)

### 1. Resolve Documentation Inconsistencies

**Priority: Critical**

- Multiple inconsistencies found across 72 documents
- Should be resolved before implementation begins
- See “Design Documentation Inconsistencies Found” artifact for full list

### 2. Create Canonical References

- Single source of truth for message formats
- Definitive port assignments
- Clear agent naming conventions
- Standardized configuration structure

### 3. Timestamp Standardization

**Recommendation**: Use epoch timestamps with millisecond precision

- Format: `1234567890.123` (float)
- Benefits: Performance, precision, compact, sortable
- Human-readable versions can be added by logging agent only

### 4. Object Classification Field

**Recommendation**: Use `class` field name

- Aligns with computer vision terminology (YOLO)
- Use simple values like “green” unless subcategories needed
- More appropriate than generic “type”

## Communication Enhancements

### 1. Time Synchronization

- NTP-based time sync across agents
- Useful for distributed deployments

### 2. Reliability Patterns

- Circuit breaker pattern for failure isolation
- Message deduplication
- Guaranteed delivery with retries
- Connection recovery mechanisms

### 3. Performance Optimizations

- Message batching for high throughput
- Compression for large payloads
- Zero-copy messaging for image data
- Connection pooling

### 4. Security Additions

- Message authentication (HMAC)
- Payload encryption for sensitive data
- Access control lists

### 5. Testing Infrastructure

- Message replay systems
- Chaos injection for resilience testing
- Network failure simulation

### 6. Monitoring Extensions

- Message tracing with hop tracking
- Communication health metrics
- Latency profiling

### 7. Advanced Patterns

- Distributed state consistency
- Dynamic agent discovery
- Event sourcing for state recovery

## Implementation Enhancements

### 1. Error Handling

- Timeout configurations on all sockets
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Automatic reconnection logic

### 2. Production Hardening

- High water mark tuning
- Buffer size optimization
- Thread pool configuration

### 3. Deployment Patterns

- Multi-site network topology
- Load balancer integration
- Container orchestration support
