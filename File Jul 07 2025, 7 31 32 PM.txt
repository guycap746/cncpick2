🧪 Agent Profile: simulator_agent – cncpick2

This document describes the simulator agent, which generates synthetic objects, triggers virtual camera inputs, and mimics conveyor behavior for full-system testing.

⸻

🧠 Agent Overview
	•	Acts as the synthetic input generator for the system
	•	Mimics object spawning on conveyor belts across lanes
	•	Supports multiple scenario modes (sanity test, throughput test, randomized)
	•	Used in development, CI, and simulation harness

⸻

📂 Responsibilities
	1.	Emit object_spawned messages at configurable intervals
	2.	Assign ground truth metadata (lane, ID, size)
	3.	Sync spawned objects to vision_agent input timeline
	4.	Notify when all test objects have been spawned

📄 Scenario File Format

Scenario files define the order and properties of simulated drops:

[
  {"object_id": "uuid1", "lane": 0, "delay_ms": 500},
  {"object_id": "uuid2", "lane": 1, "delay_ms": 600}
]

⚙️ Configuration Fields

simulator_agent:
  scenario: "tests/scenarios/sanity_test.json"
  repeat: false
  frame_rate: 30
  simulation_speed: 1.0


⸻

🧪 Sanity Test Role
	•	Defines known object flow and IDs
	•	Ensures exact match between ground truth and detected

⸻

🧠 Integration Targets
	•	vision_agent: receives camera feed or synthetic overlays
	•	data_logging_agent: logs spawn events
	•	test_runner: listens for sim_done

⸻

📌 Summary
	•	Replaces physical conveyor + camera in sim mode
	•	Enables precise test harness behavior
	•	Powers full system evaluation without hardware
