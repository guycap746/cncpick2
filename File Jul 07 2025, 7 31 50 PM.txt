👀 Agent Profile: post_pick_monitor_agent – cncpick2

This document outlines the behavior and analysis performed by the post-pick monitor agent, which helps verify system performance and missed pickups.

⸻

🧠 Agent Overview
	•	Monitors camera feed after CNC pickup zone
	•	Tracks objects that pass without being picked
	•	Compares detections to original object_detected events
	•	Logs:
	•	Missed pickups
	•	Objects never assigned
	•	Detection mismatches

⸻

📂 Responsibilities
	1.	Run YOLO (or same vision logic) post-pickup
	2.	Attempt to match seen objects to original detections
	3.	Track:
	•	Unpicked targets
	•	False negatives
	•	Repeated detections
	4.	Publish optional performance stats

⸻

📥 Subscribed Inputs
	•	Camera feed (real or sim)
	•	Optional: reference data from data_logging_agent

📤 Optional Published Events

object_missed

{
  "event": "object_missed",
  "payload": {
    "object_id": "uuid1",
    "lane": 2,
    "reason": "missed_pickup"
  }
}

object_never_assigned

{
  "event": "object_never_assigned",
  "payload": {
    "object_id": "uuid2",
    "lane": 1
  }
}


⸻

🔍 Matching Logic
	•	Uses lane, area, and time proximity
	•	Can compare object classes, shape, and location
	•	Uses object ID history if linked
	•	Flags:
	•	Duplicate sightings
	•	Low confidence matches
	•	Unseen expected pickups

⸻

🧪 Sanity Test Role
	•	Verifies zero false negatives during baseline test
	•	Ensures no ghost detections appear post-pick

⸻

⚙️ Configuration Fields

post_pick_monitor_agent:
  camera_input: "post_pickup_cam"
  enable_comparison: true
  match_tolerance: 0.12
  flag_duplicates: true


⸻

🧠 Future Enhancements
	•	Feedback into vision_agent confidence scores
	•	Data stream to learning_feedback_agent
	•	Outlier detection

⸻

📌 Summary
	•	Observes what escapes pickup
	•	Helps tune detection + scoring pipelines
	•	Aids in test result accuracy and false-negative detection
	•	Optional but critical in advanced system tuning
