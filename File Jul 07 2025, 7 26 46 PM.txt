ðŸ§  AI Learning Feedback Agent Design â€“ cncpick2

This document outlines the proposed design of an experimental learning_feedback_agent, intended for future development to improve detection and scoring quality using real-time system outcomes.

â¸»

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
	â€¢	Monitor real-world pickup results
	â€¢	Learn from missed pickups, reassignments, and false detections
	â€¢	Recommend lane adjustments, scoring weights, or YOLO fine-tuning

â¸»

ðŸ“¥ Inputs
	â€¢	Event bus messages:
	â€¢	object_assigned
	â€¢	object_picked
	â€¢	object_missed
	â€¢	object_not_assigned
	â€¢	object_detected
	â€¢	pickup_success_rate (metrics agent)
	â€¢	Access to vision metadata and post-pick logs

â¸»

ðŸ§ª Feedback Domains

Domain	Signal Type	Actionable Change
Lane Mapping	Missed by lane	Adjust x_min/x_max thresholds
Vision Model	False positives/neg	Refine YOLO annotations
Scoring Logic	Low-quality pick success	Tune weights on area/confidence


â¸»

ðŸ”„ Output
	â€¢	Logs to learning_feedback_agent.log
	â€¢	learning_recommendation events

{
  "event": "learning_recommendation",
  "agent": "learning_feedback_agent",
  "recommendation": "Decrease lane 2 x_min by 10px",
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "source": "missed_pickup"
}


â¸»

ðŸš§ Deployment
	â€¢	Disabled by default
	â€¢	Only active in simulation or training mode
	â€¢	May later inform adaptive scoring or model retraining

ðŸ“Œ Summary

The AI feedback agent is designed as a future-facing enhancement to enable continuous improvement of lane mapping, detection, and scoring logic by learning from operational results in simulation and deployment.
