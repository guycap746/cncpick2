🔐 Agent Reliability & Error Handling Strategy – cncpick2

This document defines strategies for ensuring agent robustness, safe recovery, and system fault tolerance across both simulation and hardware deployments.

⸻

🎯 Goals
	•	Keep agents resilient to partial failures
	•	Provide observable health signals
	•	Support restartability and in-place diagnostics

⸻

🧠 Agent Watchdog Expectations

Each agent must:
	•	Log a startup_complete event
	•	Periodically emit heartbeat or status_ping
	•	Log internal errors with tracebacks

Example heartbeat:

{
  "event": "agent_heartbeat",
  "agent": "motion_agent",
  "timestamp": 1234567890.0,
  "status": "ok"
}


⸻

❗ Error Types

Type	Response Mechanism
G-code Failures	Log error, retry or halt sequence
Missing Detection	Timeout → scoring reassessment
Pickup Timeout	Trigger missed pickup event
Invalid Lane	Log + discard event or reclassify


⸻

🔄 Restartability
	•	Agents read partial state from cache/logs on restart
	•	Motion agent resumes from ready_position
	•	Vision agent auto-syncs to live feed
	•	Data logging agent appends logs

⸻

🧪 Health Monitoring
	•	Future: safety_agent monitors all heartbeats
	•	Unresponsive agent → auto log + retry handler
	•	Dashboard shows red/yellow/green statuses

⸻

💥 Crash Isolation
	•	One agent failing should not halt others
	•	ZMQ channel isolation ensures event flow continuity

⸻

📌 Summary

This reliability plan ensures each agent is fault-tolerant, testable under stress, and provides the necessary telemetry and logs to support debugging, auto-recovery, and safe restarts during both development and production.
