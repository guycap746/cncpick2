🧪 Simulation Agent Design – cncpick2

This document outlines the structure, purpose, and behavior of the simulation agent responsible for mimicking real-world hardware events.

⸻

🎯 Purpose
	•	Replace real cameras, CNCs, and sensors with controlled virtual equivalents
	•	Provide synthetic data to downstream agents
	•	Enable safe and repeatable testing for development and CI

⸻

🏗️ Responsibilities
	1.	Object Spawning
	•	Emit object_spawned events at controlled intervals
	•	Vary object class, position, and size (lane-spaced or randomized)
	2.	Mock RGB + Depth Feeds
	•	Simulate camera streams to vision_agent
	•	Optionally feed pre-recorded frames or synthetic images
	3.	Trigger Zone Simulation
	•	Simulates downstream object presence for trigger_agent
	•	Emulates motion across conveyor and zone entry
	4.	GRBL Driver Emulation
	•	grbl_driver_agent mirrors GRBL command responses
	•	Simulates move times, G-code acknowledgment, and vacuum toggling

⸻

📦 Output Messages
	•	object_spawned → to vision_agent
	•	pickup_ready → to trigger_agent
	•	motion_acknowledged → to motion_agent (via driver)

⚙️ Configurable Inputs

scenario:
  object_types: [green_circuit, blue_clip]
  lanes: 4
  drop_interval_ms: 1500
  size_noise: true
  use_depth: true


⸻

🧪 Test Harness Integration
	•	Hooks into sanity test suite
	•	Scenario builder outputs mock sequences
	•	Agent logs events for timeline replay

📌 Summary

The simulation agent allows full-stack verification of cncpick2 workflows before any physical hardware is present. It ensures the vision, trigger, scoring, and motion logic can operate end-to-end under controlled conditions.
