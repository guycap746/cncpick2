🔄 Future Agent Profile: recovery_agent – cncpick2

This document outlines the concept of a recovery_agent responsible for detecting system stalls or failure modes and attempting automatic resolution.

⸻

🧠 Agent Overview
	•	Monitors for motion failures, missed triggers, or long delays
	•	Detects stalled agents, jammed objects, or repeated failures
	•	Attempts to reset motion or notify human operator
	•	Optional but useful for autonomous resilience in unattended operation

⸻

📂 Responsibilities
	1.	Monitor time elapsed since object assignment or trigger request
	2.	Detect timeouts or unexpected gaps in event sequence
	3.	Issue resets, reassignments, or escalation events

⸻

📥 Subscribed Events
	•	object_assigned
	•	object_ready_for_pickup
	•	object_picked
	•	motion_agent_ready

⸻

⚠️ Timeout Tracking
	•	Starts timer on assignment
	•	Expects pickup to occur within configured time window
	•	Flags if:
	•	Trigger never arrived
	•	Pickup failed silently
	•	Motion agent never returned to ready

⸻

🔧 Configuration Example

recovery_agent:
  pickup_timeout_sec: 10
  trigger_timeout_sec: 5
  enable_soft_reset: true

📤 Recovery Actions

recovery_event

{
  "event": "recovery_event",
  "payload": {
    "type": "timeout",
    "agent": "motion_agent_1",
    "object_id": "uuid4"
  }
}


⸻

🛠️ Optional Capabilities
	•	Revoke stale assignments and return object to queue
	•	Request jog move to clear pickup area
	•	Notify external operator system via alert

⸻

📌 Summary
	•	Watches for systemic failure patterns
	•	Helps return system to functional state after faults
	•	Recommended for long-running unattended deployments
