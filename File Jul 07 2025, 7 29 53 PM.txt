🛡️ Future Agent Profile: safety_agent – cncpick2

This document outlines a future safety_agent responsible for monitoring system-wide health and enforcing safe operation conditions.

⸻

🧠 Agent Overview
	•	Monitors for hazardous or out-of-bounds behavior
	•	Verifies motion plans, object alignment, and vacuum state
	•	Can halt operations in emergency scenarios
	•	Optional in simulation; critical for physical deployment

⸻

📂 Responsibilities
	1.	Subscribe to motion and trigger events
	2.	Monitor for collision risk, pickup anomalies, or unsafe sequences
	3.	Issue halt_system commands if safety threshold breached
	4.	Optionally perform pre-check on G-code sequences

⸻

📥 Subscribed Events
	•	object_assigned
	•	object_ready_for_pickup
	•	object_picked
	•	object_dropped
	•	recovery_event

⸻

📤 Published Commands

halt_system

{
  "event": "halt_system",
  "payload": {
    "reason": "Z overtravel risk on lane 3"
  }
}


⸻

⚠️ Safety Policies

Examples:
	•	Z-axis must not exceed configured max depth
	•	CNC arm must be at safe height before lateral move
	•	Vacuum must be ON during pickup
	•	Object must not be picked outside assigned lane

⸻

🔧 Configuration Options

safety_agent:
  enable_safety_checks: true
  max_z_mm: 45
  vacuum_required_for_pick: true


⸻

🚨 Emergency Behavior
	•	On halt_system, all motion agents stop G-code streams
	•	System enters paused state
	•	Recovery may require operator override or recovery_agent

⸻

📌 Summary
	•	Provides real-time safety enforcement
	•	Reacts to unsafe conditions across motion and object flow
	•	Highly recommended for physical deployment
