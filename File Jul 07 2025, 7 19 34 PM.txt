☁️ Cloud Sync & Backup Strategy – cncpick2

This document outlines methods for backing up, syncing, and optionally sharing system artifacts and configuration data across machines or remote teams.

⸻

🎯 Goals
	•	Preserve logs, configs, and calibration between sessions
	•	Allow team-wide sharing of snapshots and results
	•	Enable external review of test runs and debug data

⸻

🔐 Files to Sync

Category	Example Files
Logs	logs/session_*.jsonl, SQLite
Calibration	calibration/calib_matrix.json
Configs	config/*.yaml
Test Outputs	tests/logs/*.json, results_summary.json
Video / Overlay	exports/*.mp4, frames/*.png


⸻

🔄 Sync Strategies

Tool	Purpose
rclone	Drive, Dropbox, or S3 syncing
rsync	Fast LAN/USB transfers
zip + upload	Export bundles for email / archive
GitHub Releases	Optional tagged exports


⸻

🔁 Backup Hooks
	•	on_session_end() callback in test harness
	•	Compress logs + calibration + summary:

zip results_2025-07-08.zip logs/ calibration/ tests/logs/

	•	Upload to: /backup, S3, or Google Drive

⸻

☁️ Shared Team Modes
	•	Shared S3 bucket or Drive folder
	•	Nightly rsync from local device
	•	Notebook-friendly logs (Jupyter/Colab)
